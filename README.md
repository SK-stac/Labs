Creating a Small Business Network in GNS3

Implemented a robust Small Office Network using GNS3 and Fortinet VPN technology. Configured a Fortinet Firewall/Router to enforce comprehensive internal and external communication policies. Integrated LAN and DMZ switches, meticulously configuring them to ensure seamless internal network connectivity. Orchestrated the setup of a Win-10 Workstation, Domain Controller, IIS Server, LAMP, and FTP Server for diverse functionality.

To enhance security, strategically positioned the LAMP and FTP servers in the DMZ, effectively mitigating external traffic impact on the core network. Leveraged draw.io to meticulously map out the network layout, providing a clear and insightful visualization of the entire architecture. This comprehensive approach ensures a well-organized, secure, and high-performance Small Office Network.
